This the PHP style suite (PolyStyle, see http://polystyle.com) used to format the code of the structWSFand conStruct projects. The file example.php-code defines the coding standards for these projects. Additionally we have these additional requirements:

* Indent character: space
* Tab width: 2
* Max blank lines: 2
* Encoding: UTF-8
* New line: Unix
* Page width: 120
* Keep HTML cases

To use PolyStyle, you have to unzip the file StructuredDynamics_v_0_1-style-suite_full.zip into the folder "/polystyle/examples/.../" to make it available to PolyStyle to format your PHP files according to this coding standard.
